      <h1>FarmGuard: AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection and Advisory System</h1>
      <p> FarmGuard: AI-Powered Crop Disease Detection and Advisory System is an advanced agricultural technology platform designed to support farmers through early identification of crop diseases and real-time decision-making. 
        It integrates artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as environmental sensors and camera modules, to continuously monitor field conditions.
        By capturing and analyzing images of crop leaves and evaluating data from soil and weather sensors, the system can detect diseases at early stages.
        The AI model, often trained on large datasets of diseased and healthy leaves, identifies the type and severity of diseases with high accuracy.
        Once a disease is detected, FarmGuard sends instant alerts to the farmerâ€™s mobile or web dashboard, along with tailored treatment suggestions, thereby helping reduce crop damage and avoid the spread of infection.</p>
